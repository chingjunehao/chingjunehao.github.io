_Well, start blogging, it will be fun, they said...._  
  
 

## Start to blog, now!
Well, actually I have been thinking to blog for a long long time. But, keep feeling lack of time to do so _(Guess that just an excuse for me to be lazy)_. Then, I came across of few articles/blogs that stated that we can improve our learning by blogging.  
As when we are blogging, we will have a mindset that we are teaching or sharing ideas with others. By this, we will try to have a deeper understanding on certain topic before writing our blog.  
> "The best way to test your understanding is to explain it to others."  
  
Apart from improving the learning, I wish to share the my ideas/knowledge(even just a little) to the public, as there will always has someone that behind me who is struggling the same problem which I had struggled before.  
  
_So, why not?_  
  
### The content in this blog can be separated into 3 parts:  
* My thoughts on some issues/technologies
* Machine Learning
* Travelling
