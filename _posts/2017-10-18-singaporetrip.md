This is the fifth time I travelled to Singapore as a Malaysian. I kept telling myself to update the travelling blog since my second visit to Singapore but having too much works crunched on me, so it delayed until today.

This time, I visited Singapore with my family. On the first day, we are just like typical tourists in Singapore, we visited Garden by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands. I have took some photos along the way.

Then we walk to the new park at the bay area.

Along the way I have took one image of the tree which I like a lot.

The park is super spacious and a lot of people stayed there to have picnic, the places are definitely worth to visit! By the time we left there, we have the chance to enjoy beautiful sunset there.

After leaving the park, we walk back to the MRT station and have the chance to take the photo of the Singapore flyer at night.

> That's the first day of our trip in Singapore, though the places we visited are just typical travelling site for tourists, but those places are still being developed by the Singapore government. So those places are still changing every time I visit Singapore. After another year, those places are still worth to visit again!

On the second day, we decided to walk around at the park around Botanic Garden MRT station and look for some famous food in Singapore.
Some sites in the park are still developing, but the scene inside the park is super beautiful! I even take one of the photo that I took there as my profile picture!

After visiting the park with the animals of zodiac sign, we went to the park with various type of flowers.

* Pictures of flowers that I think are nice from my camera. (LOL!)

![f3](/images/flower3.jpg)
* Also the flowers that used as my profile picture! Haha!

> That's all with the park, I regret not taking more pictures with those flowers, should have taken more.....

After that, we continue walking to a tall tower that in the park. (I'm not sure with what it called....)

* The tower that we visited!

I have taken the image of the stairs from bottom and also from the top, for a guy that fears of height like me, it's really scary when I climbed to the top. Now I know why those motivators always say "You need to overcome your fear in order to reach higher.". Of course! The photos that took up there is totally worth it!

* This is the photo that I took while standing near the **dangerous** site of the stairs..........

* This is the scenery that I said **"Totally worth to get up!"**

After visiting and walking around for the whole morning, it's time to eat!
We went to [Platform 1094](http://www.ffl.com.sg/Platform1094/Home), a magic themed restaurant. I have taken few photos of the food that we ordered, but sadly I have forgotten the name of the food...

* The food there is tasty! The atmosphere is nice as well!

![firedrink](/images/firedrink.gif)
* The Goblet of Fire drink that worth a try in the restaurant!

After that, we continue our journey of eating to [White Restaurant Jalan Tampang](http://whiterestaurant.com.sg/). The white beehoon there is nice!

> That's all for our second day. As a Malaysian, I don't really try the food that is originally from Malaysia in Singapore, those food is only in Singapore and is rare to find in Malaysia and is worth a try!

On the last day, which is the third day of our journey. We just have a casual walk at the chinatown and clarke quay. It was in the morning, so the scenery is not that good, will visit that in night again next time!

Of course, because leaving Singapore, get some food more! For a durian lover like me, would like to eat durian anywhere I go.

> That's all for the fifth visit in Singapore, all in all, I'm still regret not taking more photos there... Will take more in the next visit!
