This is the fifth time I travelled to Singapore as a Malaysian. I kept telling myself to update the travelling blog since my second visit to Singapore but having too much works crunched on me, so it delayed until today.

This time, I visited Singapore with my family. On the first day, we are just like typical tourists in Singapore, we visited Garden by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands. I have took some photos along the way.
