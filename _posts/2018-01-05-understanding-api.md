The first time I heard of API was when I started learning programming. The first reaction was like "The heck? API? Application program interface? So? What can we do with it?" 
I was completely blurred and have no idea with it.

Then, I go and research about "API", there comes another term - RESTful. Which threw me into a deep sea of confusion. So, I 
decided to write a post on this to help those who struggling with the term of API or RESTful API.

Confused? Yea, me too. In a simple explanation, API is basically a function, where you pass in parameter(s), and return you result. 

Then, what is a RESTful API?

In a simple explanation, it is a function that uses the rules of GET, PUT, POST and DELETE to manipulate the data. Which is a function
that hosted in a server on cloud.
