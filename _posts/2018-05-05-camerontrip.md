During my last semester break, we had planned to travel to our senior's hometown, which is Cameron Highland in Pahang, Malaysia!(Also as a **farewell trip** before he graduates, hopefully he can _graduate_ this time... hahaha). 

We first visited his flower garden, yes he owned one **big** flower garden!
Here's some of the photos of his flowers and the lower garden!

* His flower garden! (Most of the family business in Cameron Highland is planting flowers/vegetables and sell to the markets)

* The **Pure** passion fruit juice that treated from him! The best passion fruit juice I ever drank!

On that day, we visited mountain Brinchang, the highest mountain of Cameron Highland!

After visiting the nature in Cameron Highland, we go to the famous restaurant ar Tanah Rata of Cameron Highland, [Jasmine Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jasmine-Cafe-Tanah-Rata-Camerons/192263030816018).

At night, we had fun in his home and had a crazy bbq session.

Lastly, if you have a friend with pick-up car, your journey will be doubled the fun!

* Those wind that hit on our faces is just _AMAZING_!!!

> In this trip, we did enjoy and relax ourselves from the packed-with-work university life. The weather on Cameron Highland is really nice for those who stay under hot sun throughout the years. Weather and people there are nice, surely will visit again!
