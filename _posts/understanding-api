The first time I heard of API was backed in 2 years when I was taking Foundation in IT. The first reaction was like 
"The heck? API? Application program interface? So? What can we do with it?" I was completely blurred and have no idea with it.

At the same time I was reseraching about "API", there comes another term - RESTful. Which threw me into a deep sea of confusion.

So, I decided to write a post on this to help those who struggling with the term of API or RESTful API.


basically it is function on cloud
