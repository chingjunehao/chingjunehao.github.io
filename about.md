I'm a first year undergraduate student currently studying Computer Science at Multimedia University, Malaysia.

I love travelling around to meet new people and trying out new things.

I'm interested in the field of machine learning and deep learning. I have took Machine Learning course that offered by Andrew Ng on Coursera, currently taking [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) to learn the practical deep learning.


### Courses I'd highly recommend

* [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects by University of California, San Diego on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)

* [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
