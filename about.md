I'm a first year undergraduate student currently studying Computer Science at Multimedia University, Malaysia.

I love travelling around to meet new people and trying out new things.

I'm interested in the field of machine learning, psychology and debate as well.  

I post things about traveling and also machine learning.
  
_Nothing much more..._
